# Wonderwall
Wonderwall is a general purpose and functional programming language without parenthese

See the philosophy behind it: [basics.md](basics.md)

# Run
**All of the avaliable code is in the [src](/src) folder**

*make:* `clang++ -Oz main.cpp -o wonderwall.out`

**G++**
<br>
`grun` or `g++ main.cpp -Ofast`

**Clang++**
<br>
Windows: `clrun`
<br>
Linux : `./run.sh`
<br>


However, clang and g++ are somehow incompatible and the code is only able to run efficiently on g++ (Recommending using clang++)
