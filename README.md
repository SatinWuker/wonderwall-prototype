# Wonderwall
Wonderwall is a general purpose and functional programming language without parenthese

See the philosophy behind it: [basics.md](basics.md)
If you want to add any new feature or make any suggestions about *wonderwall*'s basics, please issue!

Basic infrastructure:

# Run - New Code
The new code is in the [src-new](src-new)
<br>
The new code is developed only with Clang++.

**Windows:** `build`
<br>
**Linux:** `chmod u+x build.sh`
<br>
`./build.sh`

# Run - Old Code
Notice: this project is still in planning phase, the code in src is the testing prototype, in which I ignored code quality and efficiency. Apology. Yet, the code will eventually be written in rust, and the final prototype will be published around March 1st.

Currently recruiting devs who are familiar with rust, optimization, code review, OR compiler development & LLVM!!! Please contact me on discord, SatinW#0572, or join the Rickroll progamming language official server.

**build:** `clang++ -Oz main.cpp -o wonderwall.out`

**G++**
<br>
`grun` or `g++ main.cpp -Ofast`

**Clang++**
<br>
Windows: `clrun`
<br>
Linux : `./run.sh`
<br>
